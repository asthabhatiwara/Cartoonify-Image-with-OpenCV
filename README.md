# Cartooning an Image using OpenCV â€“ Python
Implementation of Digital Image Smoothing Filters, Edge Detection Algorithms in order to create a cartoon effect.

## Cartonify.py
This file imports all required required modules.<br/>
  1. easygui: Imported to open a file box. It will allow us to select any file from our system.<br/>
  2. Matplotlib: For visualization and plotting of images.
  
## Cartoonizer.py
This file contains a Cartoonizer class that applies a cartoon effect to an Image.

## Detecting and Emphasizing Edges
   1. Convert the original color image into grayscale
   2. Using adaptive thresholding to detect and emphasize the edges in an edge mask-
        + For detecting edges here we use adaptive thresholdig that will give us more satisfying results in compared to simple thresholding. 
        + We use cv2.adaptiveThreshold() function which calculates the threshold for smaller regions of the image. 
        + In this way, we get different thresholds for different regions of the same image. That is the reason why this function is very suitable for our goal.
        + It will emphasize black edges around objects in the image.
   3. For better illustration, we apply a median blur to reduce image noise
    
## Image Filtering
   1. Implementation of bilateral filter for edge preserving and noise reduction-
        + Similarly to the Gaussian, bilateral filter replaces each pixel value with a weighted average of nearby pixel values. 
        + However, the difference between these two filters is that a bilateral filter takes into account the variation of pixel intensities in order to preserve edges. 
        + The idea is that two nearby pixels that occupy nearby spatial locations also must have some similarity in the intensity levels.
  
 ## Creating a Cartoon effect
   Masking edged image with our colored image by using bitwise_and operation.
